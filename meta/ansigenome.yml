  synopsis: |
    This role allows you to select/manage packages over a heterogeneous set of
    hosts using Ansible.

    It was written to allow to have the maximum level of flexibility in regards
    to selecting which packages should be installed on which host. Normally
    Ansible works by making host groups in your inventory and configuring the
    packages to install for those groups. This has certain downsides when the
    complexity increases. For example, imagine that one of those hosts runs a
    different distribution/OS. Also, when you have groups of packages in the
    order of hundreds (to keep it generic), you would probably mess up your
    Ansible inventory and your configuration would be distributed over hundreds
    of files. Also this approach would not be practical because seeing all
    those package groups which apply for a given hosts is not easy to
    understand when you just want the big picture of software installed on this
    host. Therefore this role puts its focus on packages, groups of packages
    and classes of hosts while allowing to overwrite package names to match the
    naming used by different distributions or versions of distributions.

    ### Why make it that complicated?

    Well, it started when I found more and more nice software in Debian
    repositories combined with the need to install/provision different kinds of
    systems with a certain subset of the software I know/have tested.

    Those different systems include:

    * My workstation
    * Servers/VMs/virtual appliances
    * Workstation systems for other people
    * [Linux based systems for schools](https://github.com/ypid/ansible-linuxmuster_net_client)
    * Live systems

    ### History

    Before I knew Ansible, I had a shell script which asked me which
    categories I wanted to install.
    Now that I know Ansible I have something slightly more advanced :wink:

    ### Variable prefixes

    All variables are prefixed by the name of this role to avoid conflicts.

    Furthermore, there are a number of variable namespaces:

    * single: Name of a single package defaulting to the name in Debian stable.
      This can be used if other distributions (for instance Ubuntu) call a
      package differently.

    * group: A set of packages which fit in the same topic.

      * core: CLI only, does not require X

    * class: List of all packages for a specific class of hosts.

    * deploy: Options related to the installation and removal of packages as
      provided by the package management modules in Ansible.

    It is preferred when group names match
    [Debtags](https://wiki.debian.org/Debtags) for the packages they group
    together. For example `field`.

    ### Variable suffixes

    For `group` variables, certain suffixes are defined:

    * minimal: Minimal set of packages of the group.
    * basic: Basic set of packages of the group (including minimal).
    * additional: Additional set of packages.
    * full: Union of the minimal, basic and all the additional sets.

    ### How to deal with the abstraction this role introduces?

    There is a export feature available which you can use to generate package
    lists for the different classes. Furthermore you can keep those lists under
    version control so you can see what a change to a package group is
    resulting in for the different classes and if that is what you intended.

    ### Role variables

    Check the [defaults/main.yml][] for a list of all default variables and
    package presets available.

    ### Requirements

    This role makes extensive use of some recently introduced features of
    Ansible 2.  One of those features, namely iterating over using a include
    tasks multiple times with `when_*` had a bug so this role currently only
    works with a latest [devel][ansible-devel] version as of 2016-04-18.
